<p>There are a lot of packages for Python, for example, SciPy is the most popular library for advanced math. Suppose you need to work with the function <code class="java">csgraph_from_dense</code> from this module: it constructs a sparse graph representation from a dense matrix. This function is located in the <code class="java">csgraph</code> submodule of the <code class="java">sparse</code> subpackage of the <code class="java">scipy</code> library.</p>

<p>Take a look at the code below. If we run it right now, we will get the ImportError. Can you figure out what is wrong with this code snippet? Fix the mistake and run the code again.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>

<html><body><h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>An interesting idea has come to your mind. Let's change the rules of game. Players take turns taking <code class="java">X</code> pencils until none of them remain.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Expand your program by creating a loop. Each player takes turns removing pencils until 0 pencils remain on the table. Each iteration prints 2 lines: lines with pencils (vertical bars) and whose turn is now by printing the <code class="java">*NameX*'s turn</code> string.</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">How many pencils would you like to use:
&gt; 5
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
&gt; John
|||||
John's turn:
&gt; 2
|||
Jack's turn:
&gt; 1
||
John's turn:
&gt; 2</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">How many pencils would you like to use:
&gt; 15
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
&gt; John
|||||||||||||||
John's turn:
&gt; 8
|||||||
Jack's turn:
&gt; 7</code></pre></body></html>

<html><body><h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>You and your friend decided to play a simple pen-and-paper game. There's one catch â€” you have only pencils but no paper; the last piece of paper is gone for your beautiful drawings. As a joke, your friend pulls all the pencils out of the case onto the table and says: "Your turn!"</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should print two lines: one line with several vertical bar symbols representing pencils (for example, <code class="java">|||</code> or <code class="java">|||||||</code>) and one <code class="java">Your turn!</code> string.</p>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">||||||||
Your turn! </code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">|||
Your turn!</code></pre></body></html>
